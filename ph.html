              <b>The digital divide - the gap between students who lack access to technology and those who don't - is compounding equity problems within Philippine schools.</b>
              <br>
            </h6>
            
            <p style="color: white; letter-spacing: 1.5px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.1px; -webkit-text-stroke-color: white; text-align: left;">
              
              <br>
              
              The lack of access to technology especially impedes a student's ability to complete homework and online assignments. This situation can only be expected to grow worse, as more teachers incorporate technology into their curricula.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              
              One recommendation for schools is to expand access to devices and faster internet speeds. Administrators are considering programs that help to rectify device and internet access imbalances, such as one-to-one laptop initiatives. However, purchasing technology is costly - especially when it comes to replacements and upgrades.

              <b>A survey finds 85% of underserved students in the US have access to only one digital device. For most of them, it's the smartphone.</b>

              <br>
              
              - New research on students who took the ACT test, conducted by the ACT Center for Equity in Learning, found that 85% of underserved (low income, minority, or first generation in college) students had access to only one device at home, most often a smartphone.
              <br>
              
              - American Indian/Alaskan, Hispanic/Latino, and African American students had the least access. White and Asian students had the most.
              <br>
              
              - Nearly a quarter of students who reported that family income was <$36,000 a year had access to only a single device at home - a 19% gap compared to students whose family income was more than $100,000.
              <br>
              
              - The most commonly reported home internet connection was a monthly cellular data plan.

              - Students from low-income families who rely on just a monthly cellular data plan reported that their home internet is higher quality, more reliable, and faster than the internet connection at school.

              RISING* aims to conquer the digital divide between high school students who can and can't afford wireless Internet access.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              
              Accessing the Internet from a mobile device is the easiest and (typically) the cheapest way for people living in impoverished areas to connect to the web.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              
              Digital literacy is important for today's students to give them the tools and know-how to use technology for education and job skills training.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              
              - As long as students, teachers, and parents are taught how to use smartphones for academic purposes, smartphones can be a powerful tool instead of a hindrance to good grades and learning.
              
              <br>
              
              - Make sure teachers are assigning electronic materials that can be easily found, viewed and used on smartphones.
              
              <br>
              
              - Make sure teachers are mindful of the amount of data a particular assignment might use. (Especially when a single phone is sometimes shared among family members, data allowances can be eaten up quickly, leaving families with a high bill and the possibility of phones being turned off for non-payment.)

              <b><u>Secondary School</u></b>
              <br>
              By the time children move to secondary school, many of them leave the public school system. Almost half of the country's total high schools are private, with 21% of secondary school students in the country attending private institutions.
              <br>
              Among students who do continue within the public school system, roughly 90% go on to attend general secondary school, with the other 10% opting instead for vocational secondary schools. There are also "Science Secondary Schools," which are reserved for students who are determined to be particularly gifted science, technology or math by the end of their primary school career.
              <br>
              Secondary schools are public and don't pick their students; they're open to all students in the direct region. Private secondary schools, however, are completely different; they're often highly competitive and students must do well on their entrance examination score in order to be offered a spot. Though they're public, Science High School admission is also based on placement in entrance exams.
              <br>
              Overall, secondary school takes six years, spanning from grades seven to 12. Students typically graduate at age 18. While the curriculum varies grade by grade and school by school, the general subjects of math, science, social studies, civics and language arts are continued throughout secondary school.

              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Prepping for College</b> - Filipino high school students are required to take university exams. Students may come from families with limited resources and worry about finances and possible scholarships that would enable them to continue on to the next level of education. While there are no requirements for supplemental classes outside of high school, there are review classes or centers for students who are preparing to take university entrance exams.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Family</b> - The common household in the Philippines is a one or two parent family with extended family members living in the same house. Same-gender parent families, while not uncommon, are also not the norm. A students' natural parents may not both be professionals and households may have one-parent income. Fathers generally are the head of the family in terms of being the financial provider and in life-changing decision making for the entire family. However, mothers exert great influence in discipline and daily behavior of children. Filipino students may be hesitant to engage parents in open dialogue about decisions concerning themselves. They may be seen as indecisive as they are not used to making personal choices.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Teen Life</b> - In terms of life-changing decision making that will impact the future of students, parents make the decisions. In terms of decision making related to money, students are totally dependent on their parents. In regards to school involvement, students have greater independence. Students are not used to deciding without consulting parents.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Responsibilities</b> - Traditionally in the Philippines, mothers or elder female extended family members take on the household chores. Many families, even lower class families often have household help. Many students do not have their own bedroom or bathroom to clean. Chores such as common bathroom cleaning, washing dishes and laundering and pressing clothes is usually done by the household help. The older siblings in the family may know how to cook, but if they have domestic help at home, they may not have cooking skills. If they cook, cleaning up is usually done by the help. They are unlikely to have a microwave oven, dishwasher or washing machine.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Parental Involvement</b> - Regarding computer use and online monitoring, most Filipino students will not have a PC at home. So, students are usually not monitored by their parents when it comes to computer usage. However, students are knowledgeable of the Internet and gaming through internet cafes outside home. In the Philippines, students share rooms, school items and often clothing with siblings. Asking for permission is needed, but sometimes it is taken for granted. In general, students do not have time for part-time work. All allowances and spending money for school, transportation, projects, snacks, socializing and personal items in the Philippines are requested from the parents.
              <br>
              Some parents are very involved in their child's school life, while others are not. In general, natural parents will be more concerned with how well students are doing in school and with school-related projects.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Mixed Gender Socializing</b> - One-on-one exclusive friendship with the opposite sex is generally frowned upon while still in high school, but it depends on whether the student is open about the relationship with his or her parents as well as parental acceptance, tolerance and open-mindedness in general. Parents are more accepting of barkada (the usual group of close friends) and schoolmates that their child socializes with.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Communication Styles</b> - Communication is generally indirect in the Philippines. It is not the norm to express negative feelings or perceptions immediately nor openly as this is seen to be unbecoming and rude behavior. Filipinos rely on non-verbal physical cues as part of communication. Students may withdraw and generally display unsocial behavior rahter than say what they feel. In general, parents and elders do not ask about feelings and emotions. So, students are not used to being expressive and may not have the breadth and depth of vocabulary to say what they really feel and mean.

                High students who receive a barrage of early cultural cues and strategies to prepare for college generally tend to succeed once they are over those who do not receive the same structured planning. This academic priming, or a cultivation of academic culture, begins early through private tutoring or extra-curricular activities. However, not all students receive the bounty of college-educated parents or parents who are adequately prepared to cultivate an academic culture for their children.

              For many high school students who still do not have access to education, it is notable because of persisting inequality and marginalization. In developing countries, students do not have access to basic education because of inequalities that originate in poverty. These children find themselves on the margins of the education system and do not benefit from learning that is vital to their intellectual and social development. Factors linked to poverty such as unemployment, illness and the illiteracy of parents multiply the risk of non-schooling and the drop-out rate of students. Many students from disadvantaged background are undeniably forced to abandon their education due to health or financial problems.
