                <b>The digital divide - the gap between students who lack access to technology and those who don't - is compounding equity problems within Philippine schools.</b>
                <br>
              </h6>
            
              <p style="color: white; letter-spacing: 1.5px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.1px; -webkit-text-stroke-color: white; text-align: left;">
                
                <br>
                The lack of access to technology especially impedes a student's ability to complete homework and online assignments. This situation can only be expected to grow worse, as more teachers incorporate technology into their curricula.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                One recommendation for schools is to expand access to devices and faster internet speeds. Administrators are considering programs that help to rectify device and internet access imbalances, such as one-to-one laptop initiatives. However, purchasing technology is costly - especially when it comes to replacements and upgrades.

                <br>
                
                Most educators, students and families tend to overlook one of the most powerful devices that's ubiquitous, even among the underserved - the smartphone.

                  <b>A survey finds 85% of underserved students in the US have access to only one digital device. For most of them, it's the smartphone.</b>
                  <br>
                </h6>
            
                <p style="color: white; letter-spacing: 1.5px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.1px; -webkit-text-stroke-color: white; text-align: left;">
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - New research on students who took the ACT test, conducted by the ACT Center for Equity in Learning, found that 85% of underserved (low income, minority, or first generation in college) students had access to only one device at home, most often a smartphone.
                  <br>
                  
                  - American Indian/Alaskan, Hispanic/Latino, and African American students had the least access. White and Asian students had the most.
                  <br>
                  
                  - Nearly a quarter of students who reported that family income was <$36,000 a year had access to only a single device at home - a 19% gap compared to students whose family income was more than $100,000.
                  <br>
                  
                  - The most commonly reported home internet connection was a monthly cellular data plan.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Students from low-income families who rely on just a monthly cellular data plan reported that their home internet is higher quality, more reliable, and faster than the internet connection at school.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Accessing the Internet from a mobile device is the easiest and (typically) the cheapest way for people living in impoverished areas to connect to the web.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Digital literacy is important for today's students to give them the tools and know-how to use technology for education and job skills training.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  - As long as students, teachers, and parents are taught how to use smartphones for academic purposes, smartphones can be a powerful tool instead of a hindrance to good grades and learning.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Make sure teachers are assigning electronic materials that can be easily found, viewed and used on smartphones.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Make sure teachers are mindful of the amount of data a particular assignment might use. (Especially when a single phone is sometimes shared among family members, data allowances can be eaten up quickly, leaving families with a high bill and the possibility of phones being turned off for non-payment.)

                Some people suggest the following recommendations in order to expand the use and impact of technology among at-risk high school youth:
                -Technology access policies should aim for one-to-one computer access;
                -Technology access policies should ensure that speedy Internet connections are available;
                -States, districts, and schools should favor technology designed to promote high levels of interactivity and engagement and make data available in multiple forms;
                -Curriculum and instruction plans should enable students to use technology to create content as well as learn material; and
                -Policymakers and educators should plan for "blended" learning environments, characterized by significant levels of teacher support and opportunities for interactions among students, as companions to technology use

                <b>There are three important components to successfully using technology with at-risk students: interactive learning, use of technology to expore and create, and the right blend of teachers and technology.</b>
                <br>
              </h6>
              <p style="color: black; letter-spacing: 1.5px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0.1px; -webkit-text-stroke-color: black; text-align: left;">
                <br>
                First, low-income teens and students of color are noticeably less likely to own computers and use the internet than their peers. Because of their students' lack of access, teachers in high-poverty schools were more than twice as likely to say that their students' lack of access to technology was a challenge in their classrooms. More dramatically, only 3% of teachers in high-poverty schools said that their students have the digital tools necessary to complete homework assignments, compared to 52% of teachers in more affluent schools.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Secondly, applications of technology in low-income schools typically involves a "drill and kill" approach in which computers take over for teachers and students are presented with information they are expected to memorize and are then tested on with multiple-choice questions. In more affluent schools, however, students tend to be immersed in more interactive environments in which material is customized based on students' learning needs and teachers supplement instruction with technology to explain concepts, coordinate student discussion, and stimulate high-level thinking.
