                The lack of access to technology especially impedes

                a student's ability to complete homework and online assignments.
                
                <br>
                This situation can only be expected to grow worse, as more teachers incorporate technology into their curricula.

                One recommendation for schools is to expand access to devices and faster internet speeds.
                
                <br>
                Administrators are considering programs that help to rectify device and internet access imbalances, such as one-to-one laptop initiatives. However, purchasing technology is costly - especially when it comes to replacements and upgrades.

                Most educators, students and families tend to overlook one of the most powerful devices that's ubiquitous, even among the underserved - the smartphone.

                  <b>A survey finds 85% of underserved students in the US have access to only one digital device. For most of them, it's the smartphone.</b>

                  - New research on students who took the ACT test, conducted by the ACT Center for Equity in Learning, found that 85% of underserved (low income, minority, or first generation in college) students had access to only one device at home, most often a smartphone.
                  <br>
                  
                  - American Indian/Alaskan, Hispanic/Latino, and African American students had the least access. White and Asian students had the most.
                  <br>
                  
                  - Nearly a quarter of students who reported that family income was <$36,000 a year had access to only a single device at home - a 19% gap compared to students whose family income was more than $100,000.
                  <br>
                  
                  - The most commonly reported home internet connection was a monthly cellular data plan.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Students from low-income families who rely on just a monthly cellular data plan reported that their home internet is higher quality, more reliable, and faster than the internet connection at school.

                  Accessing the Internet from a mobile device is the easiest and (typically) the cheapest way for people living in impoverished areas to connect to the web.

                  Digital literacy is important for today's students to give them the tools and know-how to use technology for education and job skills training.

                  - As long as students, teachers, and parents are taught how to use smartphones for academic purposes, smartphones can be a powerful tool instead of a hindrance to good grades and learning.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Make sure teachers are assigning electronic materials that can be easily found, viewed and used on smartphones.
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  - Make sure teachers are mindful of the amount of data a particular assignment might use. (Especially when a single phone is sometimes shared among family members, data allowances can be eaten up quickly, leaving families with a high bill and the possibility of phones being turned off for non-payment.)
